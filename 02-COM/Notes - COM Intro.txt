Things that are built on COM:
- Windows shell / explorer
- All user mode drivers
- IIS & Internet Explorer
- DirectX
	> Direct 3D
	> Direct 2D
	> Direct Sound
	> Direct Audio
	> Direct Setup
	> Direct Play
	> Direct Input
	> Direct Show
	> Direct Composition
	> Direct Write
	> Direct Compute
- MS Office
- All Microsoft IDEs (including Visual Studio)
- Entire .Net
- Entire VB(Visual Basic)
- WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
- All famous applications that are built on other OS, if developers want to port them to Windows then COM is the only way to do so. (For ex- Chrome, Firefox, VLC Media Player from Linux & Safari browser, iTunes from Apple were ported on Windows with the help of COM)
- Windows Registry
- Windows Desktop
- WinRT
- CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)

Creators of COM:
(Bob Atkinson), (Tony Williams), (Craig Wittenberg)

Defintion:
- COM is modular, object oriented, customizable, upgradable, programming language independent and distributable application development
- COM is better C++
- COM is programming discipline

OOP is equal to polymorphism + late binding + syntactical encapsulation + implementation inheritance 

COM is equal to polymorphism + late late binding (or real late binding) + binary encapsulation + interface inheritance + binary code reusability

(*) The following shortcomings of DLL gave rise to COM:
- DLL needs to be loaded by it's name, programmers can make mistake in DLL's name
- Not all programming languages are capable of creating DLL
- DLL is not loaded automatically, it should be done explicitly
- DLL is not Object Oriented, functions inside the class cannot be exported
- Name mangling
- extern C
- We cannot maintain multiple versions of DLL
